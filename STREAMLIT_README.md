# Streamlit Energy Adjustment Calculator

## Overview
This is a complete Streamlit replication of the Flask Energy Adjustment Calculator application. The app processes energy generation and consumption data to calculate adjustments and generate PDF reports.

## Features Implemented

### âœ… Core Functionality
1. **File Upload Support**
   - Multiple Excel file uploads for I.E.X generation data
   - Multiple Excel file uploads for C.P.P generation data  
   - Multiple Excel file uploads for consumption data
   - Proper file validation and error handling

2. **Data Processing**
   - Excel file parsing and validation
   - Date/time filtering and standardization
   - MW to kWh conversion (MW Ã— 250 for 15-minute intervals)
   - T&D loss application (separate for I.E.X and C.P.P)
   - Sequential adjustment calculation (I.E.X first, then C.P.P)

3. **Time of Day (TOD) Classification**
   - C1: Morning Peak (6:00-10:00 AM)
   - C2: Evening Peak (6:00-10:00 PM)
   - C4: Normal Hours (5:00-6:00 AM, 10:00 AM-6:00 PM)
   - C5: Night Hours (10:00 PM-5:00 AM)

4. **Sequential Adjustment Logic**
   - Step 1: I.E.X adjustment with consumption
   - Step 2: Calculate remaining consumption
   - Step 3: C.P.P adjustment with remaining consumption
   - Step 4: Calculate total excess energy

5. **Data Visualization & Analysis**
   - Summary metrics display
   - Interactive data tables (Excess Only / All Slots)
   - TOD-wise excess energy analysis
   - Bar charts for TOD distribution

6. **Financial Calculations Preview**
   - Base rate calculations (â‚¹7.25/kWh)
   - TOD-specific additional charges
   - E-Tax calculations
   - Summary totals

7. **Export & PDF Generation**
   - CSV export for all data and excess-only data
   - Basic PDF report generation
   - Custom filename generation
   - Download functionality

### âœ… User Interface Features
1. **Modern Streamlit UI**
   - Clean, responsive layout
   - Form validation with real-time feedback
   - Progress indicators and status messages
   - Tabbed data viewing
   - Metric cards for key information

2. **Error Handling**
   - Comprehensive input validation
   - File format validation
   - Data integrity checks
   - User-friendly error messages

3. **Configuration Options**
   - Enable/disable I.E.X and C.P.P sources
   - Flexible T&D loss settings
   - Auto-detection of month/year
   - Date filtering options
   - Multiplication factor for consumption

## Testing the Application

### Sample Files Created
- `sample_generation_iex.xlsx` - 96 slots of sample I.E.X generation data for July 1, 2025
- `sample_consumption.xlsx` - 96 slots of sample consumption data for July 1, 2025

### Test Steps
1. **Start the Application**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/admin/Documents/adjustment-calculator
   /Users/admin/Documents/adjustment-calculator/.venv/bin/streamlit run streamlit_app.py --server.port 8503
   ```

2. **Access the App**
   - Open browser to: http://localhost:8503

3. **Test with Sample Data**
   - Consumer Number: `12345`
   - Consumer Name: `Test Consumer`
   - Enable I.E.X Generation: âœ“
   - Upload: `sample_generation_iex.xlsx`
   - T&D Loss for I.E.X: `5.5`
   - Upload Consumption: `sample_consumption.xlsx`
   - Multiplication Factor: `1.0`
   - Auto-detect month/year: âœ“

4. **Expected Results**
   - Process 96 time slots for July 1, 2025
   - Calculate excess energy where generation > consumption
   - Show TOD-wise breakdown
   - Generate downloadable PDF reports
