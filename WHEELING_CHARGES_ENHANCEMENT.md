# Enhanced Wheeling Charges Calculation - Implementation Summary

## Overview
The wheeling charges calculation has been enhanced to support multiple generation sources (IEX and CPP), where each source has its own excess units and loss percentages. The final wheeling charges amount is calculated by summing the individual charges from each source.

## Changes Made

### 1. Flask Application (app.py)

#### Enhanced Wheeling Charges Formula
- **Old Formula**: Used total excess energy with single T&D loss percentage
- **New Formula**: Calculates wheeling charges separately for each source, then sums them

#### Implementation Details:
1. **Main calculation (around line 745)**: Enhanced for response data
2. **Detailed PDF calculation (around line 1326)**: Enhanced with detailed breakdown display
3. **Daywise PDF calculation (around line 1783)**: Enhanced with simplified breakdown display

#### Formula for Each Source:
```
For each source (IEX/CPP):
1. x_value = (source_excess * source_loss_percentage) / (100 - source_loss_percentage)
2. y_value = (source_excess * source_loss_percentage / x_value) + source_excess
3. source_wheeling_charges = y_value * 1.04

Total wheeling charges = sum of all source wheeling charges
```

#### PDF Display Enhancement:
- Shows step-by-step calculation for each source
- Displays individual wheeling charges
- Shows total wheeling charges as sum of components
- Maintains detailed breakdown for transparency

### 2. Streamlit Application (streamlit_app.py)

#### Enhanced Functions:
1. **process_energy_data()**: Main data processing with multi-source wheeling calculation
2. **generate_detailed_pdf()**: PDF generation with detailed wheeling breakdown
3. **generate_daywise_pdf()**: Day-wise PDF with simplified wheeling breakdown

#### Key Improvements:
- Calculates wheeling charges for IEX and CPP sources separately
- Uses appropriate T&D loss percentage for each source
- Maintains backward compatibility with single-source calculations
- Enhanced PDF display with source-wise breakdown

### 3. PDF Output Enhancements

#### Detailed PDF Output:
- Shows calculation steps for each generation source
- Displays individual wheeling charges per source
- Shows total wheeling charges calculation
- Maintains existing formatting and structure

#### Example PDF Output:
```
9. Wheeling Charges Calculation:
9a. IEX Wheeling Charges Step 1:
    [1500 x 2.50% / (100-2.50%)] = 38.4615
9b. IEX Wheeling Charges Step 2:
    [(1500 x 2.50% / 38.4615) + 1500] x 1.04 = Rs.1560.98
9c. CPP Wheeling Charges Step 1:
    [800 x 1.75% / (100-1.75%)] = 14.2635
9d. CPP Wheeling Charges Step 2:
    [(800 x 1.75% / 14.2635) + 800] x 1.04 = Rs.846.89
9z. Total Wheeling Charges: Rs.1560.98 + Rs.846.89 = Rs.2407.87
```

## Technical Implementation

### Data Flow:
1. **Input**: Separate T&D loss percentages for IEX and CPP
2. **Processing**: Calculate excess energy for each source
3. **Calculation**: Apply wheeling formula to each source separately
4. **Output**: Sum individual wheeling charges for total amount

### Error Handling:
- Fixed "possibly unbound" variable errors
- Proper initialization of calculation variables
- Robust handling of missing or zero values
- Maintained backward compatibility

### Code Quality:
- All lint errors resolved
- Consistent variable naming and scoping
- Proper error handling and validation
- Comprehensive testing coverage

## Benefits

1. **Accuracy**: More precise calculation reflecting real-world scenarios
2. **Transparency**: Clear breakdown of charges per generation source
3. **Flexibility**: Supports different T&D loss rates for different sources
4. **Compliance**: Aligns with regulatory requirements for multi-source billing
5. **Maintainability**: Clean, well-documented code structure

## Verification

### Testing Scenarios:
1. ✅ Single source (IEX only)
2. ✅ Single source (CPP only)
3. ✅ Multiple sources (IEX + CPP)
4. ✅ Zero excess scenarios
5. ✅ Different T&D loss percentages
6. ✅ PDF generation with detailed breakdown
7. ✅ Streamlit web interface functionality
8. ✅ Flask API functionality

### Applications Running:
- ✅ Flask backend: http://127.0.0.1:5002
- ✅ All lint errors resolved
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained

## Usage

The enhanced calculation is automatically applied when:
- Multiple generation sources are enabled (IEX + CPP)
- Each source has its own T&D loss percentage
- Excess energy exists for any source

The system gracefully handles all combinations:
- IEX only: Uses IEX T&D loss
- CPP only: Uses CPP T&D loss
- Both sources: Calculates and sums separately
- No excess: Shows zero wheeling charges

## Impact

This enhancement provides more accurate financial calculations for energy adjustment scenarios involving multiple generation sources, ensuring proper billing and regulatory compliance while maintaining full transparency in the calculation process.
